The goal of the game is to clear the board without detonating any bombs.\n\nTo play this game in Google Search, click on the **[Play]** button at [this link](https://www.google.com/search?q=minesweeper).  \n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/WzoEfKY.png\" width=50%><br/>\n</center>\n\nWith each move, one of the following is true:\n- The agent selected an invalid move (in other words, it tried to uncover a square that was uncovered as part of a previous move).  Let's assume this ends the game, and the agent loses.\n- The agent clears a square that did not contain a hidden mine.  The agent wins the game, because all squares without mines are revealed.\n- The agent clears a square that did not contain a hidden mine, but has not yet won or lost the game.\n- The agent detonates a mine and loses the game.\n\nHow might you specify the reward for each of these four cases, so that by maximizing the cumulative reward, the agent will try to win the game?\n\nAfter you have decided on your answer, run the code cell below to get credit for completing this question.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)\nq_2.solution()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-18T05:40:29.604643Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-18T05:40:29.605226Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-18T05:40:29.619381Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-18T05:40:29.605184Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-18T05:40:29.618027Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>","application/javascript":"parent.postMessage({\"jupyterEvent\": \"custom.exercise_interaction\", \"data\": {\"interactionType\": 3, \"questionType\": 4, \"questionId\": \"2_DecideReward\", \"learnToolsVersion\": \"0.3.4\", \"valueTowardsCompletion\": 0.0, \"failureMessage\": \"\", \"exceptionClass\": \"\", \"trace\": \"\", \"outcomeType\": 4}}, \"*\")"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Solution: Here's a possible solution - after each move, we give the agent a reward that tells it how well it did:\n- If agent wins the game in that move, it gets a reward of `+1`.\n- Else if the agent selects an invalid move, it gets a reward of `-10`.\n- Else if it detonates a mine, it gets a reward of `-1`.\n- Else if the agent clears a square with no hidden mine, it gets a reward of `+1/100`.\n\nTo check the validity of your answer, note that the reward for selecting an invalid move and for detonating a mine should both be negative.

There are a lot of hyperparameters involved with specifying a reinforcement learning agent, and you'll have a chance to amend them, to see how performance is affected.\n\nFirst, we'll need to make sure that your Kaggle Notebook is set up to run the code.
